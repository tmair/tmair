Hello, I'm Thomas, a Frontend Developer from Munich, Germany.

I've been working as a software developer for over 10 years writing software for desktop, mobile and the web. I'm focused on frontend web development with TypeScript for big single page applications. One of my major interests is the architecture of such applications and especially the tooling necessary to develop at scale.
